    <p>
      I am <strong>Dragonslayer Ornstein</strong>, knight of the Lord of
      Sunlight, Gwyn. I travel the world slaying <em>Dragons</em>. So far, I
      have been stymied at every turn by a lack of <em>Dragons</em> to slay,
      though this lets me claim that I have slain every <em>Dragon</em> that
      I've seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I travel next to <a href="destination.html">Poland</a> in search of some
      <em>Dragons</em> last reported in the 14th century. In my search for these
      <em>Dragons</em> I will experience what the country has to offer, seeing
      their sights and trying their foods.

      <p>
        <em>Dragons</em> are a common feature of the mythology of many nations
        of the world. In European folklore they are commonly depicted as
        amalgamations of dangerous beasts, typically reptilian with bat-like
        wings, sometimes with horns, crests, or the head of a large predatory
        animal such as a lion or wolf. They are dangerous, and breathe fire or
        poison out of their mouths.
