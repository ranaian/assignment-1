      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Orneta is a town in northern Poland, in the historical region of
        Prussia. It was founded in 1302 and features a fire-breathing
        <em>Dragon</em> on the coat of arms. According to the legend, the region
        was home to a <em>Dragon</em> that ate both livestock and civilians. It
        claimed the lives of many knights before being slain and buried in a
        cave, reportedly underneath the modern Town Hall.

      <h3>Must-See Spots</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>St John the Baptist Church</li>
        <li>Town Hall</li>
        <li>A traditional restaurant</li>
        <li>A public park</li>
        <li>
          At this point I have to admit that Orneta is in the middle of nowhere
          and has little to do outside of the few historical buildings.

      <h3>Visitor Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Orneta is a very small town, with a population of only 9000. Be polite
          and understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
          They are unlikely to allow you to enter the cave underneath the town
          hall to look for <em>Dragons</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          St John's is an active parish, and visiting should be limited to
          non-service hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Orneta is an hour and a half drive from Gdansk, and anyone seriously
          planning to visit should probably think of Orneta as a day trip from
          there, and not a destination of its own.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      Orneta is a small historical town of some small interest. Though probably
      not on the typical traveler's itenerary, it is primarily notable for its
      <em>Dragon</em> legend.
